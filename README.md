- 👋 Hi, I’m @lee96008
- 👀 I’m interested in connecting with other developers to learn from their experiences and collaborate on projects.
- 📚 Gain knowledge and skills in programming through practice and continuous learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently a new student diving into the world of programming and planning to start learning a new language soon.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will help me develop proficiency in coding and explore opportunities in the tech industry.

- ⚡ Fun facts:  In my previous career, I was a used car dealer, the past 20 years, I've also been a bookkeeper and tax preparer.  I've been exploring programming on my own to see if it's something I'm passionate about and found it definitely is.  I'm passionate about learning anything related to technology, computers, smartphones, and tablets.
I'm known among friends and family as the go-to person for tech support and I will explorer everything to learn how to solve the problem if I dont know the solution.  I love the thrill of skydiving but only have a few jumps so far.   I enjoy collecting, buying, and selling baseball and other trading cards in my free time.
Proud Grandma! I have four amazing grandsons who I love spending time with, and I'm excited to encourage their tech journey as they grow up.
